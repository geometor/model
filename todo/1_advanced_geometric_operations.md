# 1. Advanced Geometric Operations

-   **Objective:** Add support for capturing sequences of advanced geometric operations, such as those in Euclid's constructions. This functionality is being migrated from the Explorer project to be a core part of the Model library.
-   **Strategy:**
    -   Implement functions for translating, rotating, and scaling geometric elements.
    -   Develop a robust intersection engine for finding intersections between different types of geometric elements.
    -   Add support for common geometric constructions, such as angle bisectors and tangents.
    -   Create a framework for defining and executing sequences of construction steps.
