# 3. Event System

-   **Objective:** Provide a flexible event system to allow for real-time monitoring and interaction with the geometric model.
-   **Note:** A synchronous analysis hook was implemented as a temporary workaround, but a full event system is still the desired solution.
-   **Strategy:**
    -   Implement a pub/sub event system for broadcasting model events, such as `point_added`, `line_added`, etc.
    -   Integrate the event system with the `explorer` UI to provide real-time updates and feedback.
    -   Use the event system to trigger analysis and validation of the model as it is being constructed.
