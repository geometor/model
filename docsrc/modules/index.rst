- :doc:`geometor.model`

  encompasses several submodules, each tailored to specific aspects of
  geometric modeling and analysis:

  Each submodule in ``geometor.model`` plays a pivotal role, collectively
  contributing to a comprehensive and versatile toolkit for exploring and
  mastering the intricacies of geometry.

- :doc:`geometor.model.element`

  Central to the project, this submodule provides foundational elements for
  geometric constructions, like points, lines, and circles, and manages their
  properties and relationships.

- :doc:`geometor.model.wedges`
  
  Specializing in wedge-shaped geometric figures, this submodule offers tools
  for constructing and analyzing wedges within geometric models.

- :doc:`geometor.model.sections`
  
  This submodule is dedicated to handling specific sections of geometric
  constructions, enabling detailed analysis and manipulation of these segments.

- :doc:`geometor.model.chains`
  
  Focused on the creation and analysis of connected sequences of geometric
  elements, this submodule allows the exploration of patterns and relationships
  within geometric chains.

- :doc:`geometor.model.helpers`
  
  A utility submodule, providing additional functions and tools that support
  and streamline various operations within the main modeling tasks.

- :doc:`geometor.model.reports`
  
  This submodule is instrumental in generating informative reports and
  summaries of the geometric models, facilitating a clear understanding and
  presentation of the constructions.
