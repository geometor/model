mission
=======


The mission of this ``geometor.model`` project is to establish a rigorous
system for defining classical geometric constructions of points, lines and
circles. But in our case, we are not using straight edge and compass. We are
creating the geometric elements as expressions in symbolic algebra thanks to
the power of the `Sympy`_ library.
