.. _mission_statement:

.. The mission of this ``geometor.model`` project is to establish a rigorous
.. system for defining classical geometric constructions of points, lines and
.. circles. But in our case, we are not using straight edge and compass. We are
.. creating the geometric elements as expressions in symbolic algebra thanks to
.. the power of the `Sympy`_ library.

Revolutionize classical geometry exploration and mastery by blending symbolic algebra with geometric accuracy in a sophisticated Python library.

- Create a groundbreaking Python library that transforms classical geometric construction exploration through the integration of symbolic algebra.
- Enable a deep, intuitive grasp of geometric principles, tailored for both educational and advanced research pursuits.
- Cultivate a collaborative environment, fostering ongoing innovation and advancement in geometric modeling.
