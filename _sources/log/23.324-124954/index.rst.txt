First Log - Lots of changes
===========================


This log entry marks the commencement of the Geometor.model project. After
extensive changes in recent months, the project's concepts, though not new, are
entering a phase of significant development. The primary focus has been on
refining the Geometor code, transitioning from the original Geometor Explorer,
which encompassed a broad range of functions, to a more segmented approach.
This segmentation allows for a clearer division of the project's key
components: modeling, rendering, and analyzing complex geometric constructions.

The modeling aspect is tasked with creating complex geometric models, drawing
inspiration from Euclidean techniques but executed algebraically. Following
this, the rendering component brings these algebraic models to life,
visualizing them onscreen. Analysis is the next step, with a current emphasis
on exploring the golden ratio. Each of these segments will be represented
through dedicated websites.

Regular updates will be communicated via logs like this, aiming to share the
exciting developments within the project. The project's interests span
geometry, symbolic algebra, Python programming, and parallel computing, and we
eagerly anticipate future advancements.

Contributions and updates will continue in the coming days, weeks, and months,
detailing our journey with the project and the utilization of AI assistance.
For those interested in contributing or following the project's progress,
engagement is encouraged via the GitHub repository (github.com/geometor/model),
which features a discussion area for community interaction.
