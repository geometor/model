geometor.model.polygons
=======================

.. py:module:: geometor.model.polygons

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provides polygon construction and manipulation for the Model class.

   This module facilitates the creation and management of polygon elements within the model. It allows for defining polygons using lists of points or point identifiers and supports calculating properties like side lengths and area.

.. py:class:: PolygonsMixin

   Mixin for the Model class containing polygon construction operations.

   This mixin extends the Model with functionality to define polygons. It includes methods for creating polygons from both direct point objects and their corresponding string IDs, ensuring flexibility in how geometric shapes are defined.


   .. py:method:: set_polygon_by_IDs(poly_pts_IDs: list[str], classes: list[str] | None = None, ID: str = '') -> sympy.geometry.Polygon

      Find points by ID and use them with :meth:`Model.set_polygon`.

      This helper method resolves a list of point IDs to their corresponding point objects in the model and then delegates to `set_polygon` to create the polygon element.

      :param poly_pts_IDs: A list of point IDs.
      :param classes: A list of class labels.
      :param ID: A string ID for the polygon.

      :returns: The constructed :class:`sympy.geometry.polygon.Polygon`.



   .. py:method:: set_polygon(poly_pts: list[sympy.geometry.Point], classes: list[str] | None = None, ID: str = '') -> sympy.geometry.Polygon

      Set polygon (list of 3 or more points).

      This method constructs a polygon from a list of points and adds it to the model. It calculates the lengths of the polygon's sides, generates an ID if one is not provided, and logs the polygon's properties including side lengths and area.

      :param poly_pts: A list of 3 or more points defining the polygon vertices.
      :param classes: A list of class labels.
      :param ID: A string ID for the polygon. If empty, one is generated.

      :returns: The constructed :class:`sympy.geometry.polygon.Polygon`.
