geometor.model.points
=====================

.. py:module:: geometor.model.points

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provides point construction and manipulation for the Model class.

   This module handles the creation, deduplication, and management of symbolic points within the geometric model. It ensures that points are unique, properly linked to their parents, and assigned identifiers for reference.

.. py:class:: PointsMixin

   Mixin for the Model class containing point construction operations.

   This mixin augments the Model class with methods specific to point handling, particularly the `set_point` method which is the primary entry point for adding points to the model. It also manages point ID generation.


   .. py:method:: point_ID_generator() -> collections.abc.Iterator[str]


   .. py:method:: set_point(x_val: sympy.Expr, y_val: sympy.Expr, parents: list | None = None, classes: list[str] | None = None, ID: str = '', guide: bool = False) -> sympy.geometry.Point

      Adds a point to the model, finds duplicates, cleans values, and sets parents and classes.

      This method is the core mechanism for introducing points into the model. It simplifies the coordinates, checks for existing points to avoid duplicates, attempts to merge attributes if a duplicate is found, and triggers analysis hooks for the new point.

      :param x_val: The x-value of the point.
      :param y_val: The y-value of the point.
      :param parents: A list of parent elements or references.
      :param classes: A list of string names for classes defining a set of styles.
      :param ID: A text ID for use in plotting and reporting.
      :param guide: If True, the point is a guide.

      :returns: The set point.

      **example**

      .. code-block:: python

          from geometor.model import *
          model = Model("demo")
          model.set_point(0, 0, classes=["given"])
          # <spg.Point object ...>
