geometor.model.sections
=======================

.. py:module:: geometor.model.sections

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Provides section construction and manipulation for the Model class.

   This module defines the `Section` class and associated mixin methods. A section represents a sequence of three points on a line, and this module provides tools to create them, calculate their ratios, and determine if they exhibit Golden Ratio properties.

.. py:class:: SectionsMixin

   Mixin for the Model class containing section construction operations.

   This mixin equips the Model with methods to construct `Section` objects. It allows sections to be defined by listing point objects or their IDs, facilitating the study of collinear points and their proportional relationships.


   .. py:method:: set_section_by_IDs(points_IDs: list[str], classes: list[str] | None = None, ID: str = '') -> Section

      Find points by ID and use them with :meth:`Model.set_section`.

      This convenience method resolves string identifiers for points into their corresponding model elements and then creates a section. It simplifies the creation of sections when working with named points in the model.

      :param points_IDs: A list of point IDs.
      :param classes: A list of class labels.
      :param ID: A string ID for the section.

      :returns: The constructed :class:`Section`.



   .. py:method:: set_section(points: list[sympy.geometry.Point], classes: list[str] | None = None, ID: str = '') -> Section

      Set section (list of 3 points on a line).

      This method constructs a `Section` from a list of three collinear points and adds it to the model. It automatically calculates the section's ratio, generates an ID if needed, and logs the section's details including segment lengths.

      :param points: A list of 3 collinear points.
      :param classes: A list of class labels.
      :param ID: A string ID for the section. If empty, one is generated.

      :returns: The constructed :class:`Section`.



.. py:class:: Section(points: list[sympy.geometry.Point])

   .. py:attribute:: clean_expr

   .. py:method:: __hash__() -> int


   .. py:method:: __repr__() -> str


   .. py:method:: get_IDs(model: geometor.model.model.Model) -> list[str]

      Returns a list of IDs.

      This method retrieves the unique identifiers for each of the three points that define the section, referencing the provided model.

      :param model: The model containing the points.

      :returns: A list of point IDs.



   .. py:property:: ratio
      :type: sympy.Expr


      Returns the ratio of the symbolic lengths of each segment.

      This property calculates the ratio between the longer and shorter segments of the section. The result is returned as a simplified symbolic expression.

      :returns: The ratio as a symbolic expression.
