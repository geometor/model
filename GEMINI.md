# GEOMETOR Model

A Python library for creating and manipulating geometric constructions.

## Overview

The `model` library provides the foundation for other GEOMETOR applications. It defines the core data structures for geometric elements (points, lines, circles) and provides a rich API for creating, modifying, and analyzing constructions.
