class Chain:
    """
    A class representing a chain of connected golden sections,
    facilitating the extraction of segments, points, and lengths, as well as
    analyzing the flow and symmetry within the chain.

    Each chainâ€™s flow is characterized by the comparative lengths of
    consecutive segments, represented symbolically to understand the
    progression and transitions in segment lengths. Furthermore, this module
    empowers users to explore symmetry lines within chains, unveiling a subtle,
    profound aspect of geometric harmony.
