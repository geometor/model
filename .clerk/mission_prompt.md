The BOSS is asking all the project clerks to submit a one paragraph mission statement.
He will review all of them and provide feedback.
I will share other missions statements as we development them. 

We don't have anything to start with so provide your best assessment from the code and other docs present.

I like the pattern of one or three simple statements - directives - to define
the mission. Brief and memorable. Propose a one statement and three statement
version.

The mission statement should stand as a guiding principle for all decisions in
the development of the project.

provide the one and three statements in an rst block for inclusion in the website

use the following template:
```rst
mission `geometor.model`
------------------------

one statement

- three statement a
- three statement b

```
